# Rest API

In this tutorial, we would be creating a Restful API with a practical approach of clean architecture and native Golang without any frameworks.

This repo is accompanied by the article written at https://dev.to/firdavs_kasymov/restful-api.

Please read the full article, if you would like to understand how this project is structured, the API endpoints, and how to run the server.

Thanks.
